Protocol Coreline (ProLine): a neutral authority-boundary protocol defining how intelligence-generated intent transitions into real-world execution.   

# Protocol Coreline (ProLine)

Protocol Coreline (ProLine) is an experimental protocol specification that defines a neutral authority boundary between intelligence-generated intent and real-world execution.

The protocol does not determine outcomes, policies, or agent behavior.  
Instead, it specifies the structural transitions through which authority is expressed, validated, and audited when symbolic systems cross into externally effective action.

## Status

⚠️ Draft Specification — Early Architecture

ProLine is an evolving protocol concept intended for exploration, critique, and iteration.
Nothing in this repository should be considered production-ready.

---

## Problem Space

Modern systems increasingly allow:

- AI agents
- automation workflows
- scripts
- organizations
- governance systems

to generate intent capable of producing real-world state change.

However, most architectures lack a neutral protocol layer that clearly defines:

- when authority exists
- how authority transitions occur
- how execution becomes auditable
- how boundary crossing remains interruptible

ProLine explores this missing structural layer.

---

## Core Idea

ProLine treats **Authority** as the primary structural state governing execution boundaries.

Intent serves as the carrier through which Authority may be expressed.

Rather than controlling agent reasoning, the protocol shapes the moment intelligence becomes consequence.

## Authority Handshake (Conceptual Overview)

Proposed Intent  
↓  
Admissible Intent  
↓  
Authorized Intent  
↓  
Executed State Change  
↓  
Audited Execution

The protocol defines state transitions — not implementation details.

---

## Design Principles

- Authority must be explicit
- Execution must be auditable
- Actions must remain interruptible
- Protocol remains implementation-neutral
- Authority endpoints remain accountable within the execution environment

---

## What ProLine Is NOT

ProLine is not:

- an agent framework
- a cloud platform
- a workflow engine
- a policy engine
- a governance ideology

It is a structural protocol specification.

## Repository Structure

/spec  
Contains draft protocol specifications and evolving design iterations.

---

## Why This Exists

As intelligent systems become capable of initiating external action, a clear distinction is needed between:

symbolic influence  
and  
authorized execution.

ProLine proposes a grammar for that boundary.
